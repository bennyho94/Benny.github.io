## Classification problems

### Logistic Regression

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_logistic_regression.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_logistic_regression.ipynb)

This notebook consists of 4 exercises with the following problems:
- Diabetes: predict whether a patient has diabetes or not
- Human resources: predict whether an employee is leaving the job soon or not
- Star wars: predict whether someone is a star wars fan or not
- Humany activity: predict the activity of a person based on the smartphones information.

The logistic regression algorithm has been applied for dealing with the problems.

### SVM

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_SVM.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_SVM.ipynb)

This notebook consists of 3 exercises with the following problems:
- Cancer detection: predict whether it is malicious or beneign
- MNIST: goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thens of thousands of handwritten images
- 50K a year: predict whether someone is earning more than 50k a year or not

All problems have been solved with LR and SVM algorithms. Furthermore, hyperparemeter tuning has been used with random search and grid search.

### Naive Bayes - NLP

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_Naives_Bayes.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_Naives_Bayes.ipynb)

This assignment consists of 3 exercises with the following problems:
- Sentiment analysis of text messages
- Predicting the rating of the customer based on reviews
- Predicting cyber trolls based on text messages from the internet

Problems have been solved with LR, SVM and Naive Bayes algorithm with hyperparameter tuning.

### Decision Trees Ensemble Methods

[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_Decision_Trees_Ensemble_Methods.ipynb)

Predicting whether a meteor is dangerous or not based on the NASA dataset with random forest classifier and adaboost.

## Cybersecurity

### KDD'99

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_1_KDD99.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_1_KDD99.ipynb)

An assignment based on the KDD intrusion detection contest from 1999. The goal was to make an intrusion detection system using machine learning which can differentiate between normal connections and attacks on the network. This is a simple binary classification task which consists of two classes for predictions.

### NSL-KDD

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_2_NSL_KDD.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_2_NSL_KDD.ipynb)

This notebook solves a lot of the problems the KDD'99 dataset has, which identified samples that are hard to classify by using basic machine learning algorithms.

### CIDDS-01

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_3_CIDDS_01.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_3_CIDDS_01.ipynb)

The CIDDS-01 dataset was produced by simulating a network of computers (on virtual machines). This assignment is based on the first week of the internal traffic and multi-class classification has been applied.

### CIC18

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_4_CIC18.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_4_CIC18.ipynb)

This notebook solves the problem of CIC'18 dataset while holding some of the tools as zero-day attacks. Binary classification has been applied for this problem.

## Natural Language Processing
