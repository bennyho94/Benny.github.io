# Data science portfolio by Benny Ho

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for exploration of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. A seperate category is for seperate projects.

## Stand-alone projects

### Project 1
### Project 2

## Cybersecurity

### KDD'99

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_1_KDD99.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_1_KDD99.ipynb)

An assignment based on the KDD intrusion detection contest from 1999. The goal was to make an intrusion detection system using machine learning which can differentiate between normal connections and attacks on the network. This is a simple binary classification task which consists of two classes for predictions.

### NSL-KDD

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_2_NSL_KDD.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_2_NSL_KDD.ipynb)

This notebook solves a lot of the problems the KDD'99 dataset has, which identified samples that are hard to classify by using basic machine learning algorithms.

### CIDDS-01

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_3_CIDDS_01.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_3_CIDDS_01.ipynb)

The CIDDS-01 dataset was produced by simulating a network of computers (on virtual machines). This assignment is based on the first week of the internal traffic and multi-class classification has been applied.

### CIC18

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_4_CIC18.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/Assignment_4_CIC18.ipynb)

This notebook solves the problem of CIC'18 dataset while holding some of the tools as zero-day attacks. Binary classification has been applied for this problem.

## Natural Language Processing

### Restaurant Chatbot

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/chatbot_machine_learning_benny_ho.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/chatbot_machine_learning_benny_ho.ipynb)

[Github](https://github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/chatbot_deep_learning_benny_ho.ipynb)
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/bennyho94/Benny.github.io/blob/main/chatbot_deep_learning_benny_ho.ipynb)

For my graduation work, I've made a restaurant chatbot. The purpose of the project was to automate the process and provide a better customer experience and engagement throughout the website of the external client. The project consists of 2 notebooks with Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.

### Song Prediction - Recurrent Neural Network

Predicting the genre of a song given a segment of lyrics with NLP libraries and RNN algorithm. The dataset is from a Kaggle competition "RNN Competition 2020-2021"
